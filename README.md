# How it works?

It uses <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/">Spotify offical API</a> to fetch the tracks and Youtube(youtube-dl) to download the tracks. All that happens in server side and the app just downloads the mp3 file for later.

P.S:- ~~I have written a lot of Bad code, I will start improving the app and code soon.~~
I improved the code a little bit and the overall code structure. Will work on it soon.

# Tech Stack

- React Native
- Node Js (Backend Server) ~~[Will make the backend code public soon]~~
- Firebase (For Analytics)

# Known Issues

- With the latest update, a song can be downloaded only once and hence it can be present in only one playlist. This will be solved in the upcoming version as we go into more complicated database system.
- ~~While a track(/s) is getting downloaded from a particular playlist, if user exists the screen or another playlist is loaded, then the download gets cancelled.~~
- Few playlist may give error unexpectedly.
- Due to youtube policies, few songs are not downloadable. This is because some videos are regionally restricted or so. [See these limitations](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core#limitations)
- Youtube server gives `429 error`.
- ~~Downloads wrong tracks~~ Using Youtube Music now in the backend to have better and accurate results. However, you can use "Custom Downloader" to select the correct track.
- If you encounter anything else, feel free to report an issue or DM me. I will definitely work on it.
